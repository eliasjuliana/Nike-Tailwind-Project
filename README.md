# Nike Clone Project with Tailwind.css

This project is a website inspired by Nike, built with React.js, and styled using Tailwind CSS. It was created as a practical exercise to enhance my skills, specifically focusing on Tailwind.

The original design is credited to @adrianhajdin, with several modifications. I introduced a dark mode, implemented a slider for the products section, added animations, and made adjustments to the images.
